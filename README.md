Welcome to Greendizer Boilerplate

#Contents
This is a Django starter project using OAuth for authentication.
This boilerplate enables you to start your first django-powered Greendizer application.
Greendizer is a new kind of invoicing system.
It turns the invoices sent with it to an extremely rich source of data for business intelligence and process automation.

Check out [the Greendizer website](https://www.greendizer.com/) for more information.

In order to perform authentication, please modify the credentials by the ones provided to you upon registration of your application; namely:
	client_id
	client_secret
	email
